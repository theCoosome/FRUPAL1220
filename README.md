# Description
This is the Kindom of Frupal done by group 12. To compile and run you simply use make
and ./frupal. This allows you to come into the game in the top right corner of the first map.
The game movment used both cursor movement and player movement. The cursor can hover 
over the items that are outside of the "fog of war" but remain hidden under the fog. 
The controls are shown above. The sidebar should show all things needed to know for the game.
You can purchase binoculars to clear some of the fog of war or a ship which allows you to 
travel on water.
