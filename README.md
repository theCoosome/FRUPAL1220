# Description
This is the Kindom of Frupal done by group 12. To compile and run you simply use make
and ./frupal. This allows you to come into the game in the top right corner of the first map.
The game movment used both cursor movement and player movement. The cursor can hover 
over the items that are outside of the "fog of war" but remain hidden under the fog. 
The controls are shown above. The sidebar should show all things needed to know for the game.
You can purchase binoculars to clear some of the fog of war or a ship which allows you to 
travel on water. We were able to implement almost all of the original reaquirments. The only 
things that were not able to be finished on time was finalizing the obstacle interaction. 
We also wanted to have the world scroll but that remained unfinished as well. However, we
did implement many other things. We have a handful of object interactions such as, clues, hints,
food, treasure, and tools. We also allow the player the ability to buy either binoculars
upon finding them in a grovnick. The binoculars clear some of the "fog of war" that envelopes 
the Kingdom in darkness. This allows the player to see more of the kingdom. Their are ships 
placed througout the kingdom as well. The ships allow you to travel through the water. The player
is able to travel all through the kingdom, however every movement takes energy. Some  of the 
terrain, such as the swamp, is so hard to travel through it takes two energy to get through it. 
The walls are considered impassible. Be careful the energy is also taken over water and if
you lose all your energy you lose! However, find the diamon hidden in the kingdom and you will
get one trillion trillion dollars and win!
