# Description
This is the Kindom of Frupal done by group 12. To compile and run you simply use make
and ./frupal. This places you into the game in the top right corner of the first map.
The game uses both cursor movement and player movement. When the  cursor hovers
over items that are visible outside of the "fog of war" you can see stats about them in the
sidebar. While the items that remain hidden under the fog are not accessable. 
The controls are shown above. The sidebar shows all things that come up the game, such as clues. 
You can purchase binoculars to clear some of the fog. Or you can purchase a ship which allows
travel over water. We were able to implement almost all of the original reaquirments. The only 
things that we were not able to be finish on time was finalizing the obstacle interaction. 
We also wanted to have the world scroll but that remained unfinished as well. However, we
did implement many other things. We have a handful of object interactions such as, clues, hints,
food, treasure, and tools. We also allow the player the ability to buy either binoculars or ship
upon finding them in a grovnick. The binoculars clear some of the "fog of war" that envelopes 
the Kingdom in darkness and shows a larger radius to the player of the kingdom. There are ships 
placed througout the kingdom as well that can be purchased for whiffles. Whiffles can be 
gained from treasures which are also scattered througout the kindgdom. The player is able to 
travel all through the kingdom, however every movement takes energy. Some  of the 
terrains in Frupal, such as the swamp, are hard to travel through taking two energy to move
through it. The walls are considered impassible. Be careful! Energy is also taken over water 
and if you lose all your energy you lose the game! However, find the diamond hidden in the 
kingdom and you will get one trillion trillion dollars and win! Look for the clues to help you
find the diamond!
