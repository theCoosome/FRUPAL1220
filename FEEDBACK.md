# Video Notes

Nice demo video. Good on you guys for checking and fixing any memory leaks. It's understandable how scheduling is hard given world events as well as a few of you taking hard classes simultaneously. Glad that you guys were able to work it all out. Just remember, in the agile process, you succeed as a team and you also fail as a team. Always keep this in mind when trying to balance your team's work with other things and triage your tasks. This means, at the very least, being involved with team meetings and giving your input when working out problems. All requirements met.

One thing that I had wished I introduced much earlier was priority tags (high, med, low priority) and sorting your kanban board accordingly. This is what can allow everyone to work on the important bits of the product first, while not necessarily making anyone wait around on other things. It also ensures that you have a minimum viable product faster, since more critical things must be done first, ergo some form of a product, even if primitive and a bit buggy, is demo-able sooner than later. Please do feel free to take that insight with you next time you find your self in anagile team.

## Bailey Manzer

I commend you for doing your best to balance the important things in your personal life with the frupal project. Being in an agile team means always keeping the team up to date, even if that update is "no progress" *(sometimes for good reason)*. Good work abiding by that.

## Jonnie Herrera

Just be sure to be *proactive* when finding ways to help your team. It doesn't always have to be big contributions; a small contribution that keeps you in the loop once a sprint is better than no contributions one sprint and a load of them the next. Getting back in the loop takes time and puts strain on a team.

# Gameplay Notes

Game plays well. All of the core features exists. Only a few bugs exist but they don't hinder the gameplay.

* Fog of war does not get updated when running into a wall then moving

All requirements met.
